## How This Portfolio Was Built

## Timeline: August 4 - October 12, 2025 (4 weeks)

## Starting Point: Zero prior experience with GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, or Go

## Constraint: Full-time employment as Infrastructure Engineer maintained throughout

## Challenge: Prove rapid mastery of cloud-native systems through systematic design, execution, and documentation

## Execution:

- Designed a structured 4-week learning plan covering infrastructure, containerization, security, and automation

- Built a production-grade multi-tenant Kubernetes platform (3 namespaces, 10 applications)

- Implemented Zero Trust security architecture from scratch (SSH eliminated, RBAC enforced, validated)

- Developed Prometheus observability stack with service discovery

- Automated hybrid cloud infrastructure (GCP + ProxMox) using Terraform

- Built and deployed Go CI/CD pipeline to production (GitHub Actions → Docker → GCP Artifact Registry)

- Documented every step: 90+ operational procedures, 15+ troubleshooting scenarios with root cause analysis and validation

- Earned KCNA certification during this period

## Outcome:

- 99% reduction in provisioning time (6 hours → 5 minutes)

- 100% GCP budget adherence for 3 consecutive months

- 100% CI/CD pipeline success rate

- Systematic troubleshooting discipline: every problem documented with solution path

## What This Demonstrates: This is not a learning exercise or portfolio project. This is proof of:

- Architectural thinking: Designed complex systems from first principles, not following tutorials

- Execution discipline: Shipped production code under real constraints

- Operational maturity: Systematic documentation and troubleshooting at every step

- Learning velocity: Mastered 5+ complex technologies in 4 weeks while employed
Self-direction: Identified gap, designed solution, executed autonomously
