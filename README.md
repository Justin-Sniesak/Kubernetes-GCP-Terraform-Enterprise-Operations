- 2025-09-14: TROUBLESHOOTING: During the execution of the compute_proxmox.tf config file, found that the API URL, service account name, API token name, API token secret were being passed to the terminal as output. This was occuring because secrets.tf was not correctly using the proper file format of .tfvar. Additionally, it was discovered via additional errors that API.URL was the incorrect format in the provider block of computer_proxmox.tf. The correct format for this per the provider documentation is that is api_url. Finally, this specific key: value pair was also defined incorrectly in the variables.tf configuration file.
