# Platform Engineering Lab (Cloud-Native Platform)

## ðŸš€ Overview: Declarative Enterprise Kubernetes Operations

This SRE portfolio demonstrates enterprise-grade operations using Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Istio, and GCP. It focuses on IaC, security, and hybrid automationâ€”reducing operational overhead, accelerating deployment velocity, and optimizing cloud costs.

## I. Core Competency Showcase

| Pillar | Key Achievement | Demonstrated Proficiency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid IaC** | Provisioned and tore down compute resources declaratively across GCP and ProxMox using Terraform. | GCP (IAM, Billing, Secrets), ProxMox RBAC, Multi-Cloud Automation. |
| **Resilience & HA** | Engineered and validated self-healing application lifecycle and robust Persistent Volume (PV/PVC) storage. | Deployments (Rollbacks, Rollouts), ReplicaSets, Pod Troubleshooting, Stateful Workloads. |
| **Observability & Service Mesh** | Implemented a Service Mesh (Istio) for L7 traffic control and established a comprehensive Prometheus observability stack. | Istio Gateways, Service Accounts, Certificate Management, Bash Automation. |
| **Security & Zero Trust** | Eliminated SSH ingress and enforced granular role-based access policies across GCP and Kubernetes. | GCP (Secrets Manager, Service Accounts), Certificate Management, Bash Automation. |

## II. Technical Deep Dive (Proof of Work)

Detailed, timestamped documentation of all operational procedures, troubleshooting steps, and successful validations can be found in the accompanying **[OPERATIONS_LOG.md](Docs/OPERATIONS_LOG.md)** file.

## III. Highlights

ðŸ“‘ Full operational logs and troubleshooting steps are available in OPERATIONS_LOG.md

* **Reduced infra provisioning time by 99% (6h â†’ 5m)** via automated Terraform deployment.

* Standardized **multi-tenant Kubernetes across 3 namespaces** for 10+ isolated applications.

* Achieved **100% CI/CD pipeline success** rate using GitHub Actions for automated deployments.

* **Secured the platform with Zero Trust** (no SSH ingress, granular RBAC).

* **Achieved 100% budget adherence for 3 consecutive months** through proactive GCP cost optimization.
