# Platform Engineering Portfolio

## ðŸš€ Overview: Declarative Enterprise Kubernetes Operations

This project demonstrates end-to-end Kubernetes and GCP platform engineering skills, including IaC, observability, service mesh, and hybrid on-prem/cloud automation.

All experiments were executed independently, resulting in a robust environment spanning Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and On-Premises Hypervisors (ProxMox/KVM).

## I. Core Competency Showcase

| Pillar | Key Achievement | Demonstrated Proficiency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid IaC** | Provisioned and tore down compute resources declaratively across GCP and ProxMox using **Terraform**. | GCP (IAM, Billing, Secrets), ProxMox RBAC, Multi-Cloud Automation. |
| **Resilience & HA** | Engineered and validated self-healing application lifecycle and robust **Persistent Volume (PV/PVC)** storage. | Deployments (Rollbacks, Rollouts), ReplicaSets, Pod Troubleshooting, Stateful Workloads. |
| **Advanced Operations** | Implemented a **Service Mesh (Istio)** for L7 traffic control and established a comprehensive **Prometheus** observability stack. | Istio Gateways, Service Accounts, Certificate Management, Bash Automation. |

## II. Technical Deep Dive (Proof of Work)

Detailed, timestamped documentation of all operational procedures, troubleshooting steps, and successful validations can be found in the accompanying **[OPERATIONS_LOG.md](OPERATIONS_LOG.md)** file.

## III. Highlights

* Engineered, automated, and launched a full containerized Prometheus observability stack with service discovery, proactively monitoring metrics and reducing potential Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by 50%
* Architected and standardized a multi-tenant Kubernetes environment across 3 namespaces, supporting 10 distinct applications and enforcing resource quotas via ConfigMaps
* Automated end-to-end GCP infrastructure deployment via Terraform and service accounts, reducing environment spin-up/tear-down time from 6 hours to 5 minutes while ensuring immutable infrastructure
* Developed and implemented a full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, achieving a 100% build success rate and automating the deployment of 2 portfolio sites
* Secured the platform with an engineered Zero Trust pipeline on GCP, eliminating SSH ingress and defining granular, programmatic role-based access policies
* Implemented proactive GCP cost optimization measures (billing analysis, resource rightsizing) that realized a 100% on-target adherence in monthly cloud spend over 3 months
