# Kubernetes Hybrid Cloud Operations Portfolio

## ðŸš€ Overview: Declarative Enterprise Kubernetes Operations

This repository documents four weeks of intense, end-to-end Kubernetes and Cloud Native operations. It serves as a practical demonstration of advanced skills in declarative infrastructure, operational resilience, and hybrid cloud management, directly confirming competencies in all respective domains.

All experiments were executed independently, resulting in a robust environment spanning **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and **On-Premises Hypervisors (ProxMox/KVM)**.

## I. Core Competency Showcase

| Pillar | Key Achievement | Demonstrated Expertise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid IaC** | Provisioned and tore down compute resources declaratively across GCP and ProxMox using **Terraform**. | GCP (IAM, Billing, Secrets), ProxMox RBAC, Multi-Cloud Automation. |
| **Resilience & HA** | Engineered and validated self-healing application lifecycle and robust **Persistent Volume (PV/PVC)** storage. | Deployments (Rollbacks, Rollouts), ReplicaSets, Pod Troubleshooting, Stateful Workloads. |
| **Advanced Operations** | Implemented a **Service Mesh (Istio)** for L7 traffic control and established a comprehensive **Prometheus** observability stack. | Istio Gateways, Service Accounts, Certificate Management, Bash Automation. |

## II. Technical Deep Dive (Proof of Work)

Detailed, timestamped documentation of all operational procedures, troubleshooting steps, and successful validations can be found in the accompanying **[OPERATIONS_LOG.md](OPERATIONS_LOG.md)** file.
